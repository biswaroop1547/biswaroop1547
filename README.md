## About me? :monocle_face:
I am a 19 year old teen whom you will probably find with his laptop, sitting somewhere and working on something. Being an INTP yeah I like to spend most of my time like that.

Currently a Sophomore in Computer Science & Engineering at KIIT Bhubaneswar, India. I am a member of Machine learning team at Developer Students Club KIIT.

<!--I started exploring the world of CS when I was 14 years old, never found any other topic before which can satiate my curiousity in this way and the way it just keeps evolving at a rapid pace has always keep me hooked to it. Started out with Python as my first language and it still remains my favourite language which I use for writing scripts to automate a task or to scrape something from web or to build sophisticated models or for literally anything I can think of.
Linux is my favourite OS and use it for most of my tasks, my machine is running on customized Manjaro i3 setup. And yes yes I do use windows too :relieved: (rarely). -->

### Interests ? :thinking:
I am most interested in unison between Artificial Intelligence and Humans. Okay maybe it will take time to achieve that fully.
Well I work mostly on the Deep learning and Machine Learning domain and any kind of analytics. I love to read research papers and maybe try them sometimes which helps me to stay updated with the current research. So yeah spend most of my social media time in Twitter and Reddit. I've done few projects in Computer vision and NLP. Ah and I am also addicted to algorithms.

### Working on ? :computer:
- Trying out and understanding the domain of Energy Based Models and generative models (really intriguing).
- Working on a Computer Vision project for my current Internship at Sapio Analytics.
- Learning Pytorch as I previously used to work mostly with Tensorflow, pandas, sklearn, etc.
- Spending time learning Data structures and Algoritms ( using C++ mostly ).

*Would love to talk or have a chat on **any** interesting tech-related topic you can think of!* :grin:
